## <a name="week3">Week 3</a> (Feb 7/9): Web Design & Accessibility
When we talk about "web design," we're actually talking about a much wider range of concepts than graphic design--we're also talking about interaction design, usability, and accessibility. This week we'll talk about the range of design issues related to the web. On Tuesday we'll talk about the intersection of graphic design and interaction design, including Jesse James Garrett's excellent diagram showing the various elements of user experience. In class, I'll have you break into groups to look at and critique a number of websites.

On Thursday we'll talk about accessibility for the web, and I'll have you assess the usability of some pages, and then edit a page to correct accessibility errors.

## <a name="week5">Week 5</a> (Feb 21/23): Responsive Design & CSS Media Queries
Mobile devices now make up more than half of the traffic to major websites. And it's still the case that people regularly print out web pages for a variety of reasons. That means web designers need to make sure their pages work on a variety of screens, and in print format--not just on high-resolution computer monitors. The process of creating HTML and CSS that will adapt to a variety of devices is called responsive design. CSS Media Queries allow responsive design to work more effectively by determining how/where the page will be displayed. 

- **Tuesday Readings**
On Tuesday we'll look specifically at using CSS to create different versions of a page for different media types. This was covered in the CSS Fundamentals tutorial from week 2, but for review, you should look at the portion of that tutorial dealing with the topic. 
  - [Lynda.com CSS Fundamentals: Media Types & Queries](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/Media-types-media-queries/417645/484795-4.html?org=rit.edu)

- **Tuesday Exercise**
Download the [resume.zip](weekly_materials/week5/resume.zip) from the week5 folder, and unzip the contents. There will be a resume-example folder, with an index.html file, a styles.css file, and a folder with images. Rename the folder to week5, and put it in your igme230 directory.  

In class, I'll walk through the file with you, discuss the way CSS is used to format the page, and show some modifications that I made to create a print-friendly version. Then you'll create your own print-friendly version. When you're done, you'll upload the week5 directory to your igme230 directory on Banjo. Your version should be uploaded by 11:59pm tonight (Tuesday, 2/21). 

- **Thursday Readings**
On Thursday we'll dive more deeply into responsive design concepts.
  - [Lynda.com: Responsive Design Fundamentals](https://www.lynda.com/Web-Responsive-Design-tutorials/Responsive-Design-Fundamentals/104969-2.html?org=rit.edu) - Like the "CSS Fundamentals" tutorial from week 2, this is not a hands-on tutorial--instead, it is an overview of what responsive design is, why it's important, and how it's typically implemented. In class, we'll have a hands-on exercise applying these concepts. 

- **[Thursday Exercise](weekly_materials/week5/thursdayExercise.md)**: In this exercise you'll be adding CSS to a simple web page to create a basic responsive version. 
 
## <a name="week6">Week 6</a> (Feb 28/Mar 2): CSS Grids and Frameworks
Many responsive websites are built using a pre-existing framework of CSS (and often Javscript, as well) that enables the developer to focus on content and design rather than the underlying code necessary for responsive functionality. 

Because I will be in San Francisco for GDC this week, you will work through these tutorials and then implement the homework exercise on your own. 

- **Week 6 Tutorials: Do *One* of These**
  - [Building a Responsive Portfolio Site](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/Building-Responsive-Portfolio-Site/372808-2.html?org=rit.edu): A basic introduction to using a CSS framework (in this case, Skeleton) to create a responsive website. 
  - [CSS Frameworks and Grids](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Frameworks-Grids-2016-Q3-REVISION/504266-2.html?org=rit.edu): A general but more technical introduction to CSS frameworks and grids, using Foundation (a CSS and JS framwork) for the example exercises
  - [Bootstrap 3 Fundamentals](https://www.lynda.com/Bootstrap-tutorials/Bootstrap-3-Essential-Training/417641-2.html?org=rit.edu): Even though Bootstrap is now up to version 4, this tutorial covers the basics of how Bootstrap works, and how you can use it to create responsive designs. If you decide to work with Bootstrap for your project, I recommend also completing [Bootstrap 4: First Look](https://www.lynda.com/Bootstrap-tutorials/Bootstrap-4-First-Look/372547-2.html?org=rit.edu), which looks at the differences between Bootstrap 3 and 4.

- **[Week 6 Exercise](weekly_materials/week6/week6Exercise.md)**: In this exercise you'll duplicate a web page layout using a CSS Framework.  

## <a name="week7">Week 7</a> (Mar 7/9): CSS Animation & Transitions
Modern CSS can control more than just the static presentation of web pages; it can also be used for motion graphics. This week, we'll look at CSS animation and transition effects. 

- **Tuesday Readings**
  - [Lynda.com CSS:Animation](https://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Animation/439683-2.html?org=rit.edu)
- **[Tuesday Exercise](weekly_materials/week7/week7tuesdayExercise.md)**: You'll be applying what you learned in the CSS Animation tutorial to the page you created in the week 6 exercise. 
- **Thursday Exercise**: Bring a wireframe and mockup of your personal portfolio to class; you'll be broken up into small groups to critique each other's designs. 


## SPRING BREAK
[Project 2](./projects/project2.md) (a personal portfolio site using responsive design) is due at the end of spring break. 

## <a name="week8">Week 8</a> (Mar 21/23): A Few Loose Ends: CSS Flexbox, & HTML Forms
Before we move on from HTML and CSS to Javascript, there are a few more concepts we need to look at. On Tuesday, we'll look at CSS Flexbox, a relatively new approach to creating flexible, responsive page layouts. While it's only supported by relatively recent browsers, it's starting to be widely used in web design and development. And on Thursday, we'll look at HTML forms, which will become more important when we start writing code to work with them. 

This week I'll also be assigning you to groups for [project 3](projects/project3.md), and your first deliverable will be due at the end of the week. 

- **Tuesday Readings**

## <a name="week10">Week 10</a> (Apr 4/6): Javascript Programming: Events/Listeners, CSS
This week is a continuation of basic Javascript programming, with a focus on HTML events and event listeners, as well as the interaction between Javascript and CSS. 

- **[Tuesday Exercise](weekly_materials/week10/week10tuesday.md)**: You'll use some new JavaScript functions to create a currency calculator. 

Your third [group project](projects/project3.md) deliverable--wireframes for each page type on the site--is due in class on Thursday.

- **[Thursday Exercise](weekly_materials/week10/week10thursday.md)**: You'll change page content and then save those changes to cookies so that they can be applied when the page is reloaded. 

## <a name="week11">Week 11</a> (Apr 11/13): JQuery
A great deal of the Javascript on the web uses a freely-available library of code called JQuery (which, in fact, was originally written by an RIT student!). This week we'll look at JQuery and how to use it in your pages. 

- **[Tuesday Exercise](weekly_materials/week11/week11tuesday.md)**: You'll implement some basic jQuery functionality on a page. 

- **[Thursday Exercise](weekly_materials/week11/week11thursday.md)**: You'll use the jQuery UI library to extend jQuery's functionality and add UI enhancements to page.

Here's an [example practical exam](weekly_materials/week13/example-practical.pdf) for you to work through as practice. The real practical exam will be similar to this. It will have different CSS, Javascript, and  server-side requirements--but there won't be anything you haven't seen in an in-class exercise this semester. 

Your proposal for your [final project](projects/project4.md) is due this week. 

## <a name="week14">Week 14</a> (May 2/4): Web Server Basics
We'll talk about how web servers function, and how you can use .htaccess files to modify the way your pages and directories function, including creating custom 404 pages and enabling password authentication.

We'll also talk about the "LAMP" (Linux, Apache, mySQL, and PHP) web development environment, and options you have for creating your own websites--both at RIT and externally. On Thursday, you'll take the final practical exam for the class. 

I've created an *optional* exercise that teaches you how to make a working contact form for your site that generates an email message. This will not be graded, but it's a useful thing to know how to do. 
- **[Optional Tuesday Exercise](weekly_materials/week15/week15tuesday.md)**: Creating a Contact Form with a PHP Script

## <a name="finals">Finals Week</a>: Practical Exam Makeup & Final Project Due
If you fail the final practical exam in week 15 (a score lower than 7/10), you will need to take the makeup version during our final exam time slot (Tuesday, May 16, ) your [final individual project](projects/project4.md) will be due this week.
