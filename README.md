## Course Catalog Description 
This course provides an introduction to web development tools and technologies, such as X/HTML, CSS, Javascript and DHTML, AJAX, web platforms and environments, and server-side programming methods.

## Prerequisite Knowledge
I expect students in this class to have a basic working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and publishing to RIT's web hosting environment (people.rit.edu). For GDD and New Media Interactive students, that material was covered in IGME-110. For New Media Design students, my understanding is that you have also taken a class that covers basic web technologies. More information and a review exercise can be found in the [week0 folder](weekly_materials/week0). 

## Course Materials and Communication
There is no required textbook for the course, but there will be an assortment of handouts and online readings that you will receive over the course of the semester. They will be uploaded to (or linked from) this Github site. 

I will be assigning a number of tutorials from the [Lynda.com](http://lynda.com) website, which you can access for free using your RIT login. 

All course materials and example code will be distributed via Github, and you will also be learning how to use Git and Github to manage your own exercise and project files. We will be using Slack, a group communication tool, for announcements, discussions, and Q&A about class activities and projects. We'll be discussing both of these tools in week 1. 

MyCourses will *only* be used for grading (and the occasional copyrighted reading), not for distribution of materials or communication. There will be links in myCourses pointing you to this Github repository and to our class Slack. 

## Course Organization
Listening to a lecture is seldom the best way to learn to create things. As a result, when new topics are introduced I will expect you to complete the assigned readings or tutorials before class. On most Tuesdays, I will give a short lecture providing context and additional information about the assigned materials, and then we'll do an in-class exercise to practice the skills. On Thursdays where a new topic is introduced, we'll repeat that process. If Thursday is a continuation of Tuesday's topic, I will distribute the exercise in advance of class, and you will have the option to complete and submit it *before* the start of class on Thursday, or to attend and complete it during Thursday's class. 

## Attendance
Because much of the class revolves around in-class exercises, attendance is critical. If you miss a class, you should check Github and/or Slack for information on the exercise, and complete it on your own time. If you know you'll be missing a class due to a conflict, please let me know, so I can make sure you have the materials for the exercise.  

## Grading
Your final grade will be based on your projects (70%), in-class exercises (20%), and your overall participation both in-class and in Slack (10%).

I give only three possible final grades in this class. You'll receive a grade of A ("good work!"), C ("you passed, but your work was unimpressive"), or F ("this is the wrong field of study for you"), based on your overall average for the class. Here's the breakdown:

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 83%-100%	| A |
| 65%-82.9%	| C |
| 0-65%	| F |

### Projects (70% of grade)

- **[Project 1](./projects/project1.md)**: Personal Page for Class (10% of final grade, due 4 Feb 2017)

- **[Project 2](./projects/project2.md)**: Personal Portfolio (20% of final grade, due 19 March 2017)

- **[Project 3](./projects/project3.md)**: Group Project (20% of final grade, due 17 April 2017)

- **[Project 4](./projects/project4.md)**: Final Personal Project (20% of final grade, due 16 May 2017)

### In-Class Exercises (20% of final grade)
Most in-class exercises will be due at the end of the class in which it is introduced. With more challenging exercises, I will often extend the due date until the weekend. Exercises and associated materials will be always be uploaded to that week's folder in this Github repository, and linked from the [Schedule.md](Schedule.md) file with information on their required submission date and time.

### Class Participation (10% of final grade)
You are expected to attend class regularly, and to participate in the class Slack. Both count towards your participation grade. 

### Final Practical Exam (pass/fail -- not included in final grade)
There will be a final practical exam in the class, which will require you to demonstrate basic proficiency with the technologies we've covered during the semester. It is a pass/fail practical; if you receive at least 7/10 points, you pass the exam. If you fail the exam, you will have an opportunity to retake it during finals week, although you will need to earn at least 8/10 points to pass the second time. If you do not pass either exam, you will receive a failing grade in the class. If you do pass the exam, your exam grade will not impact your final grade in the class. 
	
## Course Topics & Schedule
The schedule of topics, readings, and projects can be found in the [Schedule.md](./Schedule.md) file. Materials for in-class exercises can be found in the Github folder for that week's class.  It is your responsibility to check the schedule for each week's readings. You will find the in-class exercises very challenging if you do not complete the readings and/or tutorials for that week. 

## Additional Policies

### Important RIT Deadlines
- Last day of add/drop is 30 January 2017.
- Last day to withdraw with a grade of “W” is 21 April 2017.
- You have one semester after the class has ended to challenge your grade. 

### Communication
Any updates to assignments or the syllabus will be posted in Github and automatically announced in Slack. Major announcements (such as class cancellations) will be posted in the general channel in Slack. This means you should regularly check the class Slack, and consider setting up notifications for the general channel. I check both email and Slack frequently, and will try to always respond within 24 hours (the exception to this is when I’m traveling, for which I’ll give you advance notice). You will get a faster response using Slack, with the bonus that other people in the class can help answer questions, as well. If you want to send me email, please make sure you send it from your RIT account to my primary RIT email: Elizabeth dot Lawley at rit dot edu. 
### Late Policy
If you are having problems with an assignment or have an emergency that may make you late in submitting your work, please contact me before the due date. Late assignments that have not been cleared with me before the due date may not be accepted, or will include a grade penalty. 
### Missed Classes
If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to check with classmates for notes. I will not recap classes for you. 
### Office Hours
I will have a minimum of four office hours per week. This is an excellent time to come in with questions on the course material, homework, or in class work. I am always happy to help you understand the course material or assignments—or just to chat about whatever topic you’d like. Take advantage of this time, since few students bother to talk with their professors outside of class. If for some reason I’m called away during office hours, there will be a note on the door. 
### Mobile Phones 
Please turn off sounds on your phone, so that you don’t disturb the people around you with notification noises. If you must take a call, please leave the room to do so. 
### Notices of Accommodation
If you have a “Notice of Accommodation”, I should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class or during my office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met. 
### Social Networks
I don’t initiate friend requests on Facebook, because I don’t want you to feel obligated to accept. However, I do generally accept friend requests from students. I have a private Twitter account that I seldom use, and don’t accept follower requests on it. I maintain a LinkedIn account, and am happy to connect with students there in order to help them find job-related connections. Links to my various social media accounts can be found on my website (lawley.rit.edu). 
### Policy on Incomplete Grades
Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, and then only by prior arrangement with me. Note that I only give incompletes in the event of: 1) military deployment or 2) documented and verifiable family or personal illness/emergency. Being overcommitted, overwhelmed, and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework does not fall into either of those two categories. Please come see me ASAP if you’re having difficulty so we can find a solution together. 
### Academic Dishonesty
My policy on academic dishonesty is simple: If you get caught cheating or plagiarizing, you get an “F” as a grade for the course, a letter detailing the incident goes into your records folder, and you are immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.)

Please review RIT’s policy on academic dishonesty:
