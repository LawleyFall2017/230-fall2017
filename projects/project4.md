# Project 4: Interactive Graphics on the Web

## Description
Your final project will consist of three separate interactive applications or visualizations, a navigation page that provides access to all of them, and a documentation page describing what you did and how you did it. You must incorporate some form of rendered graphics (SVG vector graphics, CSS elements, and/or canvas-based graphics), and must use JavaScript to provide interactivity. 

Your focus should be on design and interaction, rather than text (although you should include any text necessary to enhance the appearance and/or interaction of the site). In addition to demonstrating your mastery of JavaScript, the project should be visually polished and easy to navigate/use. 

I will allow you to work with a partner, but *only* if in your proposal you provide detailed breakdowns of each person's specific responsibilities. 

You also have the option to have your grade for this project replace your project 1 and 2 grades. If you choose to do that, you must indicate that in your design document, and that choice is binding (meaning you cannot change your mind if you end up with a poor grade). ***If you choose this option, you may NOT work with a partner on the project.***

## Resources
I have put together [a list of tutorials and libraries](project4-resources.md) that you can use for this project. Most of the libraries include demos of interactive graphics that you can use as inspiration for your project. If you find other sites that you think would be useful to add, let me know.  

## Project Proposal (submit to myCourses and post to GitHub by 11:59pm on Sunday, November 19)
Before thinking about the technical aspects of your project, take some time to consider how you would like to approach it. What kind of experience do you intend to create? How will the three interactive pages/applications relate to each other aesthetically and/or conceptually? What kind of interactivity will there be and how will you achieve it?

### Required Proposal Elements

- A brief (~200 word) description of what you plan to do
- Sketches (hand-drawn, digitally designed, or coded) to illustrate your ideas for the navigation page and the illustrations
- If you are proposing to work with a partner, a clear breakdown of each person's individual responsibilities
- If you plan to use this project to replace your project 1 and 2 grades, you must indicate that in this proposal; you cannot change your mind after the design document has been submitted
- A description of what you will  need to learn in order to implement your idea, and what resources you'll use to accomplish that. 
- A link to the GitHub repository for your project (see below)

### GitHub Repository
Create a new GitHub repository for this project. Initialize a README file that includes the text of your proposal. If you will be working with a partner, create a single repo and add the other person as a collaborator. (I would prefer that you make the repo public, but if you feel strongly about making it private, make sure that you add me as a collaborator, as well.) 

### Submitting Your Proposal
Submit your project proposal to the myCourses dropbox by 11:59pm on Sunday, November 19. If you are proposing to work with a partner, the proposal should include both of your names, and you should each submit a copy to myCourses.

## Final Project (Updated on GitHub and linked from your course page by 11:59 on Thursday, 14 December)

### Three Interactive Applications or Visualizations
Each of the pages should have content that is designed to fill the browser window, and includes at least one raster or vector graphic that is rendered in the browser (such as SVG, the HTML canvas, or even CSS-based shapes). While you can use CSS animations and/or transitions, you must also use JavaScript for some form of interactivity. To get "above and beyond" points you will need to implement a JavaScript library beyond jQuery/jQueryUI. 

While you can use existing demos, tutorials, and/or implementations as inspiration for what you create, you must (a) clearly note the sources that you used, and (b) make *meaningful* modifications to those sources. (If you aren't sure whether what you're planning to do meets this requirement, ask me!)

The three implementations should be related to each other, but provide variations on the core idea. That could be variations on the level of complexity for the application (e.g. a simple version, a more complex version, an advanced version), variations of the types of content (e.g. an interactive visualization of three different concepts using a comparable design for each), or variations in the type of approach used to do the same content (such as presenting the the same content using different JavaScript libraries, or different graphics formats). 

### Main Landing Page
Your main (navigation) page should show as much attention to design as your individual application pages. It should include descriptions of and links to each of the three application pages, as well as a link to your documentation page. If you worked with a partner, this page should also explain who was responsible for each aspect of the design and implementation.  You should also provide some form of JavaScript-based interactivity on this page--but make sure that it adds value to the page in some way, rather than being gratuitous. (Some possibilities would be enhanced navigation using JS, or the ability for users to customize the page.)

### Documentation Page
Your documentation page should be integrated into the site through both design and navigation. It should describe what technologies and techniques you used to create the site, what you had to learn in order to complete it, and how you went "above and beyond" the basic functionality that we covered in our in-class exercises. You should list and link to any libraries or other online resources that you incorporated, as well as any examples that inspired you. If you worked with a partner, you should have separate sections for each person describing what you worked on and what you learned in order to do it. 

### Version Control
All of your project files should be maintained in the GitHub repository you created with your proposal. Your commits to the repository will serve as documentation of your development process; any significant changes to content or function should be committed to GitHub. 

### General Requirements
- JavaScript and CSS should be linked to as external documents
- HTML and CSS should validate properly (this applies only to CSS that you create, not to linked libraries)
- All pages should be work properly in current versions of Chrome and Safari
- The site should be functional on a mobile browser (although not all functionality needs to be implemented in mobile versions)
- To get the "above and beyond" points, you must do something more than replicate the functionality from in-class exercises, or from online demos/tutorials. 

## Submitting Your Project
You must have your completed project *and* your GitHub repository linked from your main class website by 11:59pm on Thursday, 12/14. If you worked with a partner, you both must have links to the project and repo in order to receive credit. I suggest (but don't require) that you each upload your own copy of the working project to your own account, or use GitHub pages, so that you can use it as a portfolio piece.
