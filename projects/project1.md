# Project 1: Basic Personal Page

## Requirements
Create a landing page for your igme230 directory, which *must* load as the default page at the URL `http://people.rit.edu/~yourid/igme230/` . (Remember, to load as the default page in a directory, an HTML file must be named index.html) The page should include your name, a (recognizable) picture of yourself, and placeholders for links to your in-class exercises and class projects. 

Do your best to use the principles of design you learned in IGME-110 or other design classes; I want to see the best you can do. (That does not mean putting in every type of bell and whistle you can imagine; keep it simple and clean!) This is your opportunity to make a good first impression :) 

Remember to design for your audience--which in this case is me. I'll be using this page throughout the semester for two tasks: associating your face with your name, and reviewing the work you do in this class. Keep in mind that while sometimes I'll be viewing your work on a high-res 15.6" ASUS laptop running Chrome on Win 10, I'll also often be using my 9.7" iPad Pro with mobile Safari, or my 13" MacBook Pro. 

The page should use standards-compliant HTML and CSS for both formatting and positioning. This should be entirely your own work--while it is fine to take design inspiration from other websites, you must write your own HTML and CSS for this assignment. (In other projects, you will have the opportunity to work with existing frameworks and/or templates of code.) 

All of your CSS should be commented, with an explanation as to what the style is accomplishing. Here's an example:

```
/* This puts my photo on the right side of the page, adds a thin black border to the image, 
   and leaves 15px of space between the text and the image. */

#portrait {
   float: right;
   padding: 0px;
   border: 1px solid black;
   margin-left: 15px;
   }
```

## Due Date
The completed page is due at 11:59pm on Saturday, February 4th. The page should appear properly at the URL specified above by that time. You do not need to send me email or post anything to myCourses.

## Grading
I will use this rubric for grading your pages:

## Privacy Issues
Occasionally there are reasons that a student doesn't want their name and image visible on the open web. If this is the case for you, please let me know and I'll help you set up password protection that limits access to the RIT community.
