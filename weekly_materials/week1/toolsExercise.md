# Week 1 Tuesday Exercise (29 August 2017)

## Overview & Goals

We're going to use some class time today to get you set up with the communication tools we'll be using this semester. I'll only be using myCourses for grades--all content will be distributed via this Github repository, and while I'll respond to emails, you'll get faster responses (and help from your peers) if you use the Slack chat I've set up for the class. 

## Github

If you're reading this, you've figured out how to get to the class content on Github. Congratulations! 

Because these materials are in a public repository ("repo"), you don't need a Github account to access them. However, later in the semester you'll be learning how to use Git and Github to keep track of files in your own projects, so you'll need an account for that. 

Github accounts are free, but with a free account you can only have public repos, which means everybody can see all of your files. Since you'll be uploading files related to some of your assignments, and you might not want the world-at-large to see your work in progress, private repos make more sense. Happily, Github offers a free "Student Development Pack" that gives you unlimited private repos. Because you need to verify your student status with Github in order to get this perk, I'm going to have you apply for that today. That way we can be sure you'll have a working account by the time you need to start creating your own repos in week 3.

Here's the page to sign up for a GitHub account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join 

Once you have an account, go to the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) website. You can see a list there of all the perks you get--the most important one, and the only one you'll need for the class--is the unlimited private repos. 

Click on the link to get the pack. You'll need to fill out the form with your RIT email address, RIT's name, and your expected graduation date. For the "How do you plan to use GitHub?" question, you can say that you'll be using it for assignments in your web development course. 

## Slack

I've created a Slack site for our class at http://lawley-230-fall2017.slack.com/. It's set up so anyone with an @rit.edu address can create an account, just to make things easier. (NOTE: Every Slack site uses its own login and password, so even if you already use Slack for another group, you'll need to create a new user ID and password for this one.)

Your user name should include your first name and either your last initial or your last name, like this:  `lizlawley`, `liz_lawley`, or `lizl` or `liz_l`. 

After you've successfully logged into Slack, post a brief message in the #introductions channel so I know you're there, and include your GitHub user name in the message.  

## Using Visual Studio Code

The text editor I'll be using in class to demo HTML, CSS, and Javascript is Visual Studio Code. It's free and cross-platform, and supports all of the technologies we'll be using the class. To get the most out of it, however, you'll need to add some extensions. (If you prefer to use another editor, such as Brackets, that's ok--it has extensions to provide comparable functionality. However, you'll need to find and install those extensions, including one to support Git functionality, yourself.)

Both VS Code and Brackets have some functionality built in by default, but much of their power comes from their extensibility. The features that are built in to each editor vary, as well. VS Code, for instance, has native support for Git, while Brackets has native support for live web server previewing of pages.

We'll also be talking in class about VS Code's built-in HTML tools (like Emmet), as well as the additional functionality that these extensions provide.
