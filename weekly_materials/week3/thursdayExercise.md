# Week 3 Thursday In-Class Exercise (9 Feb 2017)

## Overview & Goals
Today you're going to evaluate your own project 1 page, and an official RIT page of your choosing, using WebAIM's Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool, keeping in mind the key issues discussed in today's lecture. 

## Checking Your Own Work for Accessiblity
Using the accessibility evaluator built into the [Web Developer Toolbar](https://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/) in Chrome, check your own project 1 page. Are there any errors? What are they? What barriers to access do they create? What would you need to change in your code to correct them? Write your answers to those questions in a Word or Google Docs document. (Don't change anything until after you've gotten your grade back, since I do check modification dates on files.)

## Checking an RIT Page for Accessibility
Choose an official RIT web page, and run it through the accessibility evaluator.  In the document you just created, provide the URL for the page that you reviewed, and answer the following questions: What problems did it spot? How much of an impact could those problems have on a user with accessibility issues?

## Uploading and Due Date
Before the end of class, upload the document to the Dropbox in myCourses. (If you created it in Google Docs, use File-->Download As... to save it as a Word .docx file.)
